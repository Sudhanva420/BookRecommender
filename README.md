Book Recommender System
This project implements a book recommender system using Python and the scikit-learn library, focusing on content-based filtering. The system recommends books based on their descriptions, leveraging techniques such as TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to identify similar books.
Features
Content-Based Recommendations: Provides recommendations based on the content of book descriptions.
TF-IDF Vectorization: Utilizes TF-IDF to convert text data into numerical format for analysis.
Cosine Similarity: Calculates similarity scores between books to suggest relevant titles.
Data
The recommender system uses a dataset containing book titles, authors, and descriptions. The data is sourced from the Goodreads Book Recommendation Dataset available on Kaggle.

Dependencies
Python 3.x
scikit-learn
pandas
numpy
